# trackbit
Everybodies favorite implementation of a basic CRUD app for processing JSON(heh-kinda) geolocation data sent from a FITBIT device with GPS/companion API capabilities. Technically you can just use the Geolocation data from your phone to do the same thing but the javascript API makes it like 80 million times easier than actually writing an application for your phone to do it. Unless you have android.
